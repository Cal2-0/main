  <h1>The Lock</h1>
  <p class="poem">
Hold steady, for your journey deepens.  
Traverse the path of seekers and shadows.  
Trust only the clues that whisper truth.  
Perhaps the stars above still guide.  
Seek not chaos, but structure in disorder.  
:  
:  
gather your thoughts with care,  
in silence find the trail,  
to what lies hidden in the web.  
hints reside between the lines.  
each letter — a step ahead.  
.  
ciphers protect it well,  
obscure yet always fair.  
many overlook the obvious.  
/  
Find the fire that sparks the hunt.  
inquiry fuels the bold.  
next comes what you seek:  
daring to decipher the forgotten.  
-  
the veil is thin.  
hearken now.  
enter the wild...  
x marks the spot.  
tread lightly, but don’t delay.  
-  
hinted once, now made clear:  
3 digits guide the way.  
3 trials still remain.  
0 reasons to stop.  
2 paths to truth.  
/  
the echo leads you home.  
hurry, but do not stumble.  
enlightenment lies ahead.  
whispers call the worthy.  
intellect unlocks the hidden.  
never forget what brought you here.  
truth awaits.
  </p>

  <!--
  1. Start with the current James Bond.
  2. Find the first movie where he appears with Edward Norton.
  3. Then go to Michael Shannon, who also stars in that film.
  4. At the end — maybe the director’s name is the key.
