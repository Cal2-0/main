  <h1>Path of Knowledge</h1>
  <p>
    To continue your journey, you must follow the path of knowledge.<br/>
    Start at the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Onwards</a>.<br/>
    From there, carefully follow the first link in the main text of each article.<br/><br/>

    At the end of the trail, a hidden message awaits.<br/>
    But not all clues lie ahead â€” perhaps something in a previous file will help you unlock the final key.<br/>
    Go back, look closely, and connect the pieces to proceed.
